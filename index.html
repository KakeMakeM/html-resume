        <h2>Carrer Objective</h2>
        <p>As a high school student at Panevėžio 5th Gymnasium studying web development at Uncommon.lt, I am passionate about technology and have a strong drive to learn and grow as a software engineer. My foundation in coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and familiarity with web development frameworks
             such as React and Node.js, allows me to build dynamic and functional web applications. In addition, my experience in designing user interfaces and experiences using Figma enables me to create intuitive and visually appealing designs that enhance the user experience.</p>
        <p>My current objective is to contribute my skills and knowledge to the software engineering field and continue to develop my expertise in both development and design. I am eager to collaborate with other professionals, learn from experienced mentors, and take on new challenges that allow me to expand my
             skillset and make a positive impact.</p>
